# Health Insurance Premium Prediction

Healthcare in most countries is organized in a complex bureaucracy. Many countries have the highest healthcare expenditures in the world. Countries especially like the United States have no single nationwide system of health insurance, the United States primarily relies on employers who voluntarily provide health insurance coverage to their employees and dependents.

In the changing times, we all know how much is importance given to health and harmony in the country. 

In the current scenario, As of 2019, about 2.7 million Indian immigrants resided in the United States. Today, Indian immigrants account for approximately 6 percent of the U.S. foreign-born population, making them the second-largest immigrant group in the country.

This truly states the dire need for the healthcare and requirement of proper planning for any health calamity if occurs.

In the countries where there is a high requirement for healthcare, which should definitely include the strategic planning of the insurance that one needs to pay for the prospect calamity that might occur

Anticipating this, Team Kovida has come up with a unique solution for predicting the Medical Insurance price based on different parameters we have identified
We have gone through detailed due diligence and feature analysis of parameters like the age of the person and different diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. 

Using these features we used 2 different ML algorithms one being the Random forest classifier and the other being the Decision Tree Classifier, we have built the predictive model to make a prediction on the price of the insurance given the features of the age and the diseases one posse. 

This helps the individual for the preparedness of the amount that he has to pay for the insurance and helps the countries like the US that hadn't got a detailed plan of action for healthcare.

We try to improve the model and derive business actions also out of it.
